#Create a function called print_list(a), where a is a two dimensional list. The function should print the list row by row, with one space between each element
#Create a function called swap_columns(a, i, j) that will swap the columns i and j in list a, where
#a is a two dimensional list
#i and j are the numbers of columns to be swapped
#Read the values in the file *09.02 NumbersList.txt into an two dimensional list.
#Print the list by calling print_list(a).
#Prompt for the column numbers in the list to swap by calling swap_columns(a, i, j)
#Print the list with the swapped columns by calling print_list(a)
