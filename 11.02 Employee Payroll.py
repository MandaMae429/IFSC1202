#Create a class named Employee that has the following attributes:
#FirstName
#LastName
#IDNumber
#HoursWorked
#Wage
#Create an initializer that accepts the FirstName, LastName, IDNumber, and Wage and assigns them to the appropriate attribute. Set HoursWorked to 0.
#In your main program, create the following function:
#find_employee - which has the Employee list and the EmployeeID as the arguments. This function searches the list and looks for a match on the EmployeeID. The function returns the index of the employee. If the item is not found a -1 is returned. See the find_ball function in 11.01 - Creating a List of Objects Using Instantiation
#Read the 11.02 Employees.txt file and create a list of employee objects
#Read the 11.02 Hours.txt file, update the hour worked for the appropriate employee
#Print the results
